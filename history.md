# History

Peperium is the first Art Collection on Ethereum. \
The very first card (KFPEPE) [was created on April 14, 2017](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e0aff049085074840e5b54aefe315ac8fc12928c889d622b40d6d3abdeebd4e).

So, this was before iconic projects like ENS, Curio Cards, CryptoPunks, MoonCats, CryptoKitties etc. üòç

Peperium also ticks a few other boxes:

* First pepes on Ethereum
* First NFT project that utilizes IPFS (the IPFS hash of the artwork was minted with the card)

### Card Series

Peperium consists of two Series, in the first Series there were 18 cards, in the second series there were 13 (see cards section for more info)
